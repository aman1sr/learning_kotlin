##     fun isVowel(c: Char): Int {
          if ("aeiou".contains(c)) return 1
          else return 0  }
                         Vs
       fun `fun`(c: Char): Int {
           return if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'u' || c == 'o') 1 else 0
       }
>> fun(c: Char), is generally more efficient,
- The first function, isVowel(c: Char), involves iterating through a string ("aeiou") to check if it contains the character.
- The first function creates a string ("aeiou") each time it's called, which involves memory allocation and potential garbage collection overhead.
- The second function, fun(c: Char), directly compares the character to each vowel using individual comparisons.
- Direct comparisons are usually faster than string iterations, especially for smaller sets of characters like vowels.



###         val b = (right-left).absoluteValue           // to get NON -ve no.

## count = 2 , to convert it into '2' char so can store in arrayListOf<Char>()
                ch.add(count.toString()[0])
                butt,, only good to add single digit no.



##      c2[j++] = chars[0]            // chars = ['a','a','b','b','c','c','c']
        "j= 1 , c2[0] =  'a'
        vs
        c2[j] = chars[0]; j++;

        In the first expression, j is incremented after the assignment.
        In the second expression, j is incremented independently after the assignment.


### to fill an Array [1,1,1,1]
-   val ans = IntArray(n)       // where IntArray(n)  is basically used delcare & allocate size of an array consider as: [0,0,0,0]
    Arrays.fill(ans, 1)


### clever way of returning boolean
- day4_place_flower :   return plots==0


### ||  and && operator uses short-circuit evaluation.
       OR CASE: if the first condition is true, the second condition is not evaluated at all, as the overall condition is already true.
       similarly,AND CASE:  If the first condition is false, the overall result is already guaranteed to be false, regardless of the second condition.
eg :              if(flowerbed[i]==0 &&
                 (i-1<0 || flowerbed[i-1]==0) &&                     // when i=0 & let flowerbed[i] =0                     (T,exception) = T
                 (i+1>=flowerbed.size || flowerbed[i+1]==0)){            // when i= last position  & let flowerbed[i] =0   (T, exception) = T


### check if any str exists in array (of Char)
eg :  val vowels = arrayOf('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
      val hasVowel = str.any { it in vowels }


###  cannot directly update individual characters of a string in Kotlin using the s[l1] = s[l2] syntax. Strings are immutable in Kotlin
        Use string manipulation functions to create a new string    eg: val newString = s.substring(0, l1) + s[l2] + s.substring(l1 + 1)
        Use StringBuilder


*** TRICK (day5_vowel_rev): beautiful way of keep on looping  until we find the charArray present in another a String, for the purpose of finding the>>> start location
    word -> is a charArray
    var start =0
    val vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        while (vowels.indexOf(word[start])==-1) {     // deliberately keep the while ==-1,(i.e, if we got the word in vowel by pass the While)
            start++
        }
                                            // eg--> let word = "l,l,e,e,t,c,o,d,e" if on 1st attempt when start =0, will enter the loop , similarly on 2nd loop will again enter the loop now start =3, but this time (While condition is F) , so it will byPass the while loop
