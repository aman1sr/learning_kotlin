## Classes
Classes are templates that allow you to
create your own types of objects, and define their properties and functions.

**to define your own class, you need to think about the objects
that will be created from that class. You need to consider**:
* The things each object knows about itself (properties)
* The things each object can do (functions)


## Constructor
A constructor runs when you instantiate an object. Itâ€™s used to define
properties and initialize them.
