## Higher Order Functions:
- A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as parameters or returns a function as its result. 
- It treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing you to pass them around, store them in variables, and return them from other functions. 
- Higher-order functions enable you to write more flexible and reusable code by abstracting away common patterns or behaviors. 
- They can accept lambda expressions or function references as arguments, making it easier to write concise and expressive code.

### also{} only Scope f() as HOF
- scope functions in Kotlin (let, run, with, apply, and also), the also{} function is the one that can be considered a higher-order function
- The also{} function in Kotlin is an extension function defined on the Any class, and it takes a lambda expression as a parameter. The lambda expression is invoked with the receiver object as its argument and can perform additional operations on the object.
